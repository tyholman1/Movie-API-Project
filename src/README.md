Project's Title
________________________________________________________________________________
Disney Character Search

Project Description
________________________________________________________________________________
This project uses React JS to pull API data from https://disneyapi.dev/ and display it on screen with the character's name and picture. It includes the NavBar, Home page, Search page and About page. The Home page is the main page when you first load the page and it includes the Navbar which is present throughout all of the pages. The Search page is where you can search for a Disney character with name displayed. The About page is to thank you for viewing my page and has a nice Disney Castle gif.

The Approach
________________________________________________________________________________
I had to find an API using publicapis.dev to locate which free API I wanted to use. I knew I needed components like Nav and pages like Home page. I also use psuedo code and a wireframe to plot out my React project fairly quickly.

Disclaimer: My original project was a movie availability search where users could search for a movie and locate where the movie was streaming. However, I realized the API I was using reached the daily free limit with less than 4 searches. So, I could not test my code properly without paying for more limits. Even though the project name is Movie-API-Project, it is a Disney Search project instead.

Unsolved Problems
________________________________________________________________________________
I wanted to display the movies the characters were in and maybe even link the movie to another API that can direct you to where it is streaming. I also wanted to incorporate more submenu options and a discussion or forum board.
